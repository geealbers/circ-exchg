IMAGES:
---------------------------------

<figure class="_______">
	<img src="../assets/images/__________.jpg" alt="__________" />
	<figcaption>
		____________________________
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Figures use basic HTML. Copy and paste the above template, and fill in the blanks. The alt="___" text is a short name for the image in case it doesn't load. The class="___" text can be one of three values:

	class="figure": Goes full-width of text column
	class="figure-lg":  Goes full-width of browser window
	class="figure-sm": Goes small and to the right of the text column

For the caption (<figcaption>) Text can be formatted and contain links, however, it needs to be formatted as HTML rather than Markdown:

	<em>Italic Text</em>
	<strong>Bold Text</strong>
	<a href="http://www.linkadress.com">Link Text</a>

Image files themselves go in the assets > images folder



NEW POSTS:
--------------------
New posts go in the _posts folder, and must follow a naming convention, with the date first, in the following format. The title that follows the date will be used in contructing the URL for the post: YYYY-MM-DD-short-title-here.md

At the top of each post is a required block of metdata (YAML) that appears between two lines of three dashes ---. The layout and category always remain the same. Update the other lines for each post. The thumbnail should be the complete file name of an image that is in the images folder, and will determine the thumbnail image appearing with the post title on the home page.

Template YAML metadata block:

---
layout: post
category: articles
title: 
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Kate Palmer Albers
thumbnail: _________.jpg
platform:
theme:
---
