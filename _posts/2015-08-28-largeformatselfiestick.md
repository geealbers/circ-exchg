I was introduced to the Large Format Selfie Stick via Snapchat which, in hindsight, seems just perfect. As friends of mine know, I’ve developed a mild obsession with the app, on which the default setting is for photographs to disappear shortly after they are viewed. I’ll be writing about Snapchat more in posts to come, but for now I’ll say that the alternative it proposes to our archivally-obsessed culture has been irresistible to me. And so, it was fitting to find a sketch for the Large Format Selfie Stick in that conceptually charged viewing setting (Snapchat) because it offered a glimpse – but just a glimpse – at an idea that seemed, in a nutshell, to simultaneously resist and embrace one of the most popular, and popularly-loathed, contemporary photographic obsessions: the selfie. It also seemed to address the heart of that loathing, which I peg to the fine art photography community, while gently mocking its pretensions to superiority over the “common” photographers of daily life, people who have in the past been disparagingly referred to as amateurs, shutterbugs, ___ and ___. Now they’re just people, and people have cameras, and, in a long history of “amateurs” having the gall to use some of the same technologies as Serious Professional Photographers, people – in general – have started making a lot of selfies.

Despite my interest in the circulation and exchange of images through various social media platforms, I’m not particularly interested in selfies, on the whole, but I _am_ interested in how cranky they make people (and mildly interested in how many branches of academic study have taken up studying selfies: there are scholarly study groups in selfies, conferences, panels, and, certainly, many dissertations in progress, from a range of academic fields including sociology, media studies, xxx, and xxx. By extension, I’m also interested in how selfie sticks also make people cranky, and fascinated by the real cultural questions that have come up for museums and other cultural institutions who must now navigate not just the rules of photography in their cultural spaces but also the rules of selfie sticks. 

The little sketch prompted a number of questions: Was the Large Format Selfie Stick the key to ameliorating the disdain many large format photographers seemed to naturally feel for the selfie, a form whose casually narcissistic populism flies in the face of values that hold craftsmanship, careful composition, attention to Xxx, so dear? Would people who hated the very idea of selfies, made on the fly with smartphone cameras and uploaded onto social networking sites to garner likes and comments, feel differently if they could make selfies with a “real” camera? Would it parse out which aspects of selfies and selfie sticks people hated most? (the camera? The stick? The subject? The circulation?)  Did it address the root of the anxieties of serious photographers in today’s age of photographic ubiquity? 

I almost never screenshot Snapchats (it’s the easiest way to save a Snapchat, but I mostly think of it as cheating myself out of a proper experience), but I did screenshot the LFFS because, like everyone else, I like to think I know genius when I see it:

The snap came from the photographer Jesse Chehak. Jesse is a “real” photographer, by which I mean he takes his medium very seriously, has produced several bodies of work (sometimes made with large format cameras), knows his way around a range of photographic equipment, knows his photographic history and identifies with the world of photography. He’s also conceptually-minded, experimental, and unafraid to look askance at some of the more conservative   

I’ve seen enough brilliant and playful ideas sketched out in his studio that it somehow didn’t occur to me that Jesse would go to the trouble of actually fabricating the thing, and, anyway, it existed fairly perfectly just as an idea. But a few months later, this showed up on Instagram: 

And the resulting image, tagged, naturally #TheLargeFormatSelfieStick:

As well as further documentation:

Obviously I had to try it myself, so the next time I was in Tucson, where Jesse was living at the time (he’s since moved to Milwaukee with his family), we made a date. It was, indeed, the fun of a selfie, but a lot more time consuming. And, happily, it was also not a selfie, it was an #ussie or a #groupselfie or a #

As an aside, if you ever want to feel bad about the role of selfies in contemporary culture, scroll through the 314,959,530 posts on Instagram tagged #selfie for a collective display of preening insecurity. Conversely, if you ever want a mood boost, scroll through the many fewer 87,629 posts tagged #ussie for happy smiling friends and loved ones posing impishly together. 

Making our selfie was both familiar and strange as two worlds collided in practice. First of all, the thing is a beast, made all the more unwieldy by the physics of extending a heavy object out a pole and trying to hold it from the other end. (It’s possible I almost dropped it, and Jesse kindly didn't say a word.) Though we were in the middle of the street so there would be room for the 6-foot stick, which is a re-purposed fallen tree branch, we huddled together in the familiar way to say cheese. While Jesse wrangled the camera, I had the honor of holding the shutter release cord. As there was one sheet of film in the camera, we made one exposure:

It wasn’t until we were back inside in the kitchen, running the exposed polaroid under water to develop/fix it, that I started wondering if we’d really made a selfie. If we had, wouldn’t it already be posted on Instagram? Instead we had a print, floating in water. We’d have to re-photograph it for it to exist outside of that moment and place and fulfill its selfie promise. By the time I’d had that thought, we both already made new photographs with our iPhones: I was sure to document the print before Jesse pulled it out of its paper housing to better preserve the object-ness quality of the process, while Jesse ---. We marveled at how good the exposure was – much better than his first effort. And yet neither of us could resist tweaking it a little bit in the digital version. 

It would be easy, at this point in the story, to observe that the only reason I _have_ a story is because the selfie was made with a large format camera. We were compelled to madly document our non-digital selfie because we knew it to be a singular occasion. On the other hand, I’ve also documented friends making selfie

Is the digital or the print version better? Does one have to be? I’m glad to have both. I’ve looked at the Instagram version a bunch of times since I posted it, every time I scroll back in my feed. And I know the print version is tucked away in my house

There are a lot of things for large format photographers to legitimately worry about today: will the film continue to be accessible? Will digital cameras get just as good? Will there be any magic left in photography if there’s no darkroom? Professional photographers also have to worry about whether they might still have paying jobs, or whether anyone will appreciate the difference between a print … But I don’t think they need to worry about selfies and who’s making them. 

In the end, I have to think of Alfred Stieglitz’s essay, “The Hand Camera and its Present Importance”, which he wrote in 1902 as he and his friends were grappling with what to make of all the amateur shutterbugs they saw as devaluing the craftmanship of serious photography when they all got their grubby mitts on handheld cameras, made appallingly easy by George Eastman’s Kodak Brownie camera. It’s an essay I include in my classes almost every year, and – I confess – it always makes me laugh: in a nutshell, Stieglitz – known as the father of American fine art photography -- expresses that he is willing to embrace the pedestrian snapshot camera considered so lowly by his photographic peers, but only because he’s found a way to make it difficult: by standing for hours on a streetcorner in the blinding snow and howling wind, enduring the elements to get the perfect snap. Serious photographers have always been gluttons for punishment, 

Jesse made the selfie difficult. Serious photographers, what are you waiting for?
